				life:

			<ul>
				<li>be kind</li>
				<li>reach out to people</li>
				<li>spread positivity</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Life has no definite structure.</p>
			<p>
				at times we find our hardships dragging us down and taking us steps back
				and it is okay. do what you must and take the necessary stapes to get
				through the day.
			</p>
			<p>as tomorrow holds such better days.</p>

				can take:

			<ul>
				<li>take care of your bod</li>
				<li>draw only good aspects</li>

			</ul>
			<p>

				to it is worth the effort to a better life. as by acting on these steps
				on, you have just proven that....
